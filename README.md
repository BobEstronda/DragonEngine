# DragonEngine
Dragon Engine is a basic game engine for 2D and 3D development, designed with an ECS (Entity Component System) architecture. I'm developing it in my spare time as a way of studying, with the goal of creating a multiplatform, modular and efficient solution for games of different scales.
